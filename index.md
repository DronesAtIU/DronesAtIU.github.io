## About

Drone Club is a student organization at Indiana University. We aim to introduce
students at IU to the world of radio controlled vehicles and piloting them
through a first person view. This club helps to teach new members about drones
and how to get into the hobby safely and affordably. The club hosts multiple
meetings throughout the year aimed towards bringing people together who enjoy
the hobby. However, we also offer seminars about the types of certifications,
and we conduct training for members getting into the hobby. The club also has
multiple projects throughout the year that all members are welcome to work on.
These projects include researching and building different craft for the club to
use and play with, and eventually the club plans to host events, such as drone
racing, for the public to attend.
